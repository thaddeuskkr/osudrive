# osu!drive
**A simple application, in Node.js, to help to manage multiple osu! profiles when running on one drive.**  
  
### DISCLAIMER  
**I am not promoting multi accounting.**  
The entire reason why I set up this project is because I wanted to run osu! off a thumbdrive, and needed a way to manage my friends' accounts and allow switching between computers quickly as osu! names their configuration files after the computer user's name. This program does all of that with a beautiful command line interface.  

### Security  
- osu! stores your hashed passwords in plaintext in configuration files. This program does not save any of these files, but only reads them to make it easier for management.  

### Open source  
- You are free to use this program however you want, as long as you abide by the license stated in the LICENSE file (GPL-3.0).  

### Contributing  
- We welcome any code improvements or suggestions. Just make an issue or a PR!
